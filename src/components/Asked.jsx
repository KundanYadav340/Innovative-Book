        question:"What is use of svg images while building a modern responsive website?",
        firstAnswer:"SVG images are great for those websites which need image of various sizes. Because SVG images can be zoomed to any size without decreasing the quality of image. A file with the SVG file extension is most likely a Scalable Vector Graphics file. Files in this format use an XML-based text format to describe how the image should appear. Since text is used to describe the graphic, an SVG file can be scaled to different sizes without losing qualityâ€”the format is resolution-independent. This is why website and print graphics are often built in the SVG format, so they can be resized to fit different designs in the future.",

        question: "What is the difference between UI and UX design?",
        firstAnswer: "UI design stands for User Interface design and refers to the visual and interactive elements of a product that a user interacts with. This includes things like buttons, menus, forms, and other design elements. UX design stands for User Experience design and is focused on the overall experience a user has with a product or service, including factors like usability, accessibility, and ease of use. While UI design is primarily concerned with the visual and interactive aspects of a product, UX design takes a more holistic approach, considering the entire user journey and how it can be optimized for maximum engagement and satisfaction.",

        question: "What are the benefits of using a CSS framework in web design?",
        firstAnswer: "CSS frameworks are pre-written libraries of CSS code that can be used to quickly and easily create the visual design of a website or application. Some benefits of using a CSS framework include faster development time, consistency across the design, and easier maintenance. By using a framework, designers and developers can save time by not having to write CSS code from scratch, and can instead use pre-built components to create their designs. This can lead to a more consistent visual style throughout the website or application, which can improve the user experience. Additionally, since the code is already written and tested, it can be easier to maintain and update the design over time.",

        question: "What is responsive web design and why is it important?",
        firstAnswer: "Responsive web design is a design approach that enables websites to adapt their layout and content to different screen sizes and device types, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. This means that the same website can be accessed and used by anyone, anywhere, on any device, without compromising on the user experience. Responsive web design is important because it ensures that websites are accessible, easy to use, and provide a consistent experience across all devices. Additionally, responsive web design can improve website performance and search engine rankings, since search engines prioritize mobile-friendly websites in their search results.",

        question: "What are some best practices for web accessibility?",
        firstAnswer: "Web accessibility is the practice of designing and developing websites and applications that can be used by people with disabilities. Some best practices for web accessibility include providing alternative text for images and other media, using clear and consistent navigation, ensuring that color is not the only way to convey information, providing captions and transcripts for video and audio content, and making sure that keyboard-only navigation is possible. It's also important to follow web standards and guidelines, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and to test the website with assistive technologies to ensure that it is usable by people with different types of disabilities.",
